# Transport-Management-System-using-Java
# <br>Summary<br>
This is a Transport Management System which is a basic mini project of our degree's semester curriculum. This is a basic GUI based Transport Management System for travels organizations for managing/storing/warehousing the buses, employees, trips, tickets, payments, passenger's data in our database. It can perform some basic functions like adding, deleting, fetching, calculating, printing the user input from the database and is very safe to use as only 3 types of authorized users who can access the system which are (Manager, Supervisor, Booking Clerk) and these users has different access. The manager is like admin i.e he/she can access the whole system but the main feature of a manger user is that he/she can add a new user in the system and can give them different accesses while other users doesn't that have access. The Supervisor has supervising access that he can manage the organization's section such as information of vechicles, their insurances, employee's, payments, routes, details etc. and can go through the reports also but doesn't has access to and new user and can't access booking section access such as tickets, passsengers, trips etc. The booking clerk has access only to booking sections and trips, payments, passenger's details. It is easy to use as anyone can use it or handle because its GUI based and simple. <br> This is system is built using Languages: Java for frontend, SQL for backend and Technologies: Eclipse IDE for coding, SQLyog for database, XAMPP for server.
